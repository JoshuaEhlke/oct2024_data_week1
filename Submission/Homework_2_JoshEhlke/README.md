Week 2 Bootcamp Homework 2 -VBA

The purpose of this activity is to build a better baseline understanding of coding. We are able to cut down thousands of lines of information into more readable/digestable data.

With help from a tutor, Xpert, and an in-class exercise, I was able to build this with for loops, If functions, and a large amount of variables. Unfortunately, my code disappeared after I restarted my computer. I know I had saved, but I'm not sure where it went. My alphabetical file still shows the code ran successfully. If need be, I can provide screenshots of this.

With this data, we can observe which stocks had the highest and lowest percentage of change for each quarter of the fiscal year. This can affect buying and selling decisions on the market.
